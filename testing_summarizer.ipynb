      "how good the performance is okay so I\n",

      "whether the performance improves or not\n",
      "okay so yes uh let's let okay this is\n",
      "perfect now here you'll be able to see\n",
      "the wall time is 41.5 seconds total time\n",
      "4 minute 55 seconds all the specific\n",
      "stuffs you are getting so guys uh so the\n",
      "overall time over here is somewhere\n",
      "around 41.5 seconds that basically means\n",
      "my model is basically getting trained\n",
      "within 41.5 seconds using the CPU\n",
      "instance itself uh but here in the\n",
      "description you can see that we have\n",
      "written in about 2 minutes we are able\n",
      "to fit our tree model using skygate\n",
      "learn um the reason is very simple\n",
      "because we I'm specifically using the\n",
      "high RAM T4 high RAM instance if you\n",
      "just use the T4 free tire then it is\n",
      "just going to take you somewhere around\n",
      "2 minutes to complete this entire\n",
      "training process okay now we are going\n",
      "to do the prediction with respect to the\n",
      "accuracy score um we are getting\n",
      "somewhere around 70% the classification\n",
      "report here you'll be able to see this\n",
      "okay now it's time we will try to run\n",
      "the same code with the help of skyit\n",
      "learn we'll accelerate that skyitle\n",
      "learn directly into the Nvidia GPUs okay\n",
      "uh so let's load this\n",
      "QML.xl okay so load extension QML.xl\n",
      "this is definitely for bringing that QML\n",
      "changes uh that Nvidia has actually\n",
      "brought to accelerate the skyit learn\n",
      "okay so here install accelerator for\n",
      "skarn here you can see\n",
      "this and then we will do the same steps\n",
      "what we specifically did okay and then\n",
      "we'll try to fit it for the same max\n",
      "depth okay so this will take some time\n",
      "because uh this will happen only for the\n",
      "first time okay and after that you'll be\n",
      "able to see how fast we will be able to\n",
      "do it and just by seeing the time\n",
      "difference you'll be very very happy\n",
      "because we will be having all this\n",
      "specific stuff so here you can see\n",
      "already accelerator for skyit learn has\n",
      "been uh uh installed then omap then htbs\n",
      "scan everything has been u uh in\n",
      "installed right now I'll just go ahead\n",
      "and enable this sorry uh import this\n",
      "then we will go ahead and do the same\n",
      "thing see and random forest classify and\n",
      "estimator is equal to 100 max depth all\n",
      "this stuff and then we will do fit on x\n",
      "train and y train so once we do this\n",
      "you'll be able to see that how fast\n",
      "things will happen so here you can see\n",
      "4.89 89 seconds before here you could\n",
      "see how many seconds 41.5 seconds right\n",
      "wall time this is the difference and\n",
      "because of this you can just see that\n",
      "now your entire acceleration of skyit\n",
      "learn with respect to the training is\n",
      "directly happening in the GPU and GPU\n",
      "definitely has more cores than compared\n",
      "to the CPU right so here now we can just\n",
      "go ahead and see this this is what is my\n",
      "predictions okay uh similarly you can go\n",
      "ahead and do fit on max depth is equal\n",
      "to 30 now we'll do a fit on max depth is\n",
      "equal to 30 right and then we'll see\n",
      "that how much time difference it will\n",
      "happen right because max depth 30\n",
      "obviously it'll take a lot of time in\n",
      "CPUs at least okay but with respect to\n",
      "GPUs we'll try to see before with max\n",
      "depth is equal to 5 we have just got\n",
      "4.89 89 seconds so here only 16.9\n",
      "seconds isn't it amazing right because\n",
      "the entire acceleration is now currently\n",
      "happening and the sky learn acceleration\n",
      "the training is basically happening in\n",
      "the GPU so 16.9 seconds here it is right\n",
      "now with respect to the prediction now\n",
      "see all are coming somewhere around 90\n",
      "95% and all now this is what happens\n",
      "right before when we are using sky learn\n",
      "uh and we are trying to train in the CPU\n",
      "just to do this max depth is equal to 30\n",
      "it'll definitely take a lot of amount of\n",
      "time right and uh that is the reason we\n",
      "will not even be able to probably\n",
      "improve the accuracy yes so I hope uh\n",
      "you are uh able to understand and uh\n",

Kagan\\n\\nFebruary 9, 7:30 pm ET\\n\\nClick here to see ISW’s interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\\n\\nWagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin announced on February 9 that the Wagner Group has entirely stopped recruiting prisoners. In a response to a press comment, Prigozhin claimed that Wagner’s recruitment of prisoners has \"completely stopped\" and that \"all obligations are being fulfilled\" for those currently under Wagner’s employ.[1] Prigozhin also absurdly claimed that over 10 million Americans have applied to join Wagner.[2] The Wagner Group will likely continue to recruit from prisons, albeit in a much more limited capacity. As ISW has previously noted, Wagner’s recruitment of prisoners has slowed over the last few months, an assessment confirmed by statistics by the Federal Penitentiary Service that show that decreases in the Russian prison population stabilized between November 2022 and January 2023.[3] This phenomenon is consistent with the overall trend of conventional Russian troops slowly replacing the Wagner Group around Bakhmut, indicating that Russian military command may be shifting away from its reliance on Wagner and therefore on using prisoners as cannon fodder.\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to pursue measures to gradually prepare Russia’s defense-industrial base for a protracted war in Ukraine while avoiding wider economic mobilization. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with the Supervisory Board of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives on February 9 and instructed the agency to support federal subjects in developing the production of unmanned aircraft systems.[4] Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev previously stated that Russian military manufacturers intend to expand the supply of reconnaissance and attack drones to support operations in Ukraine, and Russian and Iranian officials are reportedly planning to build a factory in Russia to manufacture 6,000 drones \"in the coming years.\"[5]\\n\\nMedvedev visited a tank manufacturing plant in Omsk Oblast on February 9 and stated that Russia needs to increase the production of various armaments, including modern tanks, in response to Western military assistance to Ukraine.[6] Dutch open-source group Oryx reported that Russian forces have lost 1,012 destroyed tanks in Ukraine with an additional 546 tanks captured by Ukrainian forces.[7] Oryx reported that these combined losses represent roughly half the tanks that Russian forces committed to Ukraine at the start of the invasion.[8] Fifteen hundred tanks are enough to equip more than 15 tank regiments or brigades or about 150 battalion tactical groups.[9] The Russian military needs to quickly replenish these tank losses to maintain the ability to conduct large-scale mechanized maneuver warfare ahead of a likely increased pace of offensive operations in eastern Ukraine. Medvedev likely framed his calls for increased production as a response to Western military assistance to obscure the fact that substantial military equipment losses are driving the need for increased production. The Kremlin’s efforts to gradually prepare Russia’s defense industrial base for a protracted war while avoiding a wider mobilization of the Russian economy continue to be incompatible with the scale of the war that the Russian military is fighting in Ukraine and the scale of Russian military equipment losses.\\n\\nA prominent Wagner-linked Russian milblogger called for the dismissal of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu over a Russian military uniform procurement scandal. Many prominent Russian military bloggers harshly criticized Shoigu and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) over news that the 22-year-old son of the Russian Deputy Head of the Federal Agency for State Property Management won a contract to supply the Russian military with new uniforms.[10] The milbloggers argued that the new uniforms are of inferior quality and overpriced (costing about 130,000-210,000 rubles or $1,780 - $2,875 per uniform) and are part of a petty corruption scheme to enrich the families of Russian defense officials. The Grey Zone Telegram channel—a prominent Wagner Group-affiliated milblogger – wrote an explicative-laden rant to its 426,000 subscribers that Shoigu has lost credibility in front of the Russian nation and that Russian President Vladimir Putin can amend the situation by firing Shoigu, Shoigu’s \"entourage\" in the Russian General Staff and banning Shoigu and his associates from all Russian military affairs.[11] This is the latest episode in a string of events that has prompted Russian military blogger communities to attack the Russian MoD and senior Kremlin officials for petty corruption and ineptitude resulting in battlefield failures and worse quality of life for average Russian soldiers.[12]\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to show that it is unwilling to curb divisive rhetoric from ultranationalist pro-war figures. Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov publicly sparred with Duma Deputy General Viktor Sobolev following Sobolev’s criticism of Kadyrov’s statements on grooming standards in the Russian military being discriminatory against Muslims and calls for the Russian military to fight satanism in Poland.[13] Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on February 9 that the Kremlin is \"not participating in this controversy and would not like to give any assessments\" about it.[14] The Kremlin will continue to tolerate divisive rhetoric from ultranationalist figures as it seeks to appeal to the wider pro-war community.\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nWagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin announced that the Wagner Group has entirely stopped recruiting prisoners.\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to pursue measures to gradually prepare Russia’s defense industrial base for a protracted war in Ukraine.\\n\\nA prominent Wagner-linked Russian milblogger called for the dismissal of Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu over a Russian military uniform procurement scandal.\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to illustrate that it is unwilling to curb divisive rhetoric from ultranationalist pro-war figures.\\n\\nRussian forces continued offensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line.\\n\\nRussian forces conducted limited ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast and the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area and continued offensive operations around Bakhmut.\\n\\nRussian forces conducted a limited ground attack in Zaporizhia Oblast.\\n\\nRussian sources claimed that the Russian military integrated a Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) volunteer formation into the Russian Armed Forces.\\n\\nRussian sources claimed that Russian authorities detained a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group attempting to assassinate Russian occupation officials.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\\n\\nRussian Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine (comprised of two subordinate main efforts)\\n\\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #1—Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and encircle northern Donetsk Oblast\\n\\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #2—Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\\n\\nRussian Supporting Effort—Southern Axis\\n\\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\\n\\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\\n\\nRussian Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine\\n\\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #1- Luhansk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and continue offensive operations into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and northern Donetsk Oblast)\\n\\nISW continues to assess that Russia\\'s most likely course of action (MLCOA) is an imminent offensive effort in Luhansk Oblast and is therefore adjusting the structure of the daily campaign assessments. We will no longer include the Eastern Kharkiv and Western Luhansk Oblast area as part of Ukrainian counteroffensives and will assess this area as a subordinate part of the Russian main effort in Eastern Ukraine. The assessment of Luhansk Oblast as part of the Russian main effort does not preclude the possibility of continued Ukrainian counteroffensive actions here or anywhere else in theater in the future. ISW will report on Ukrainian counteroffensive efforts as they occur.\\n\\nRussian forces continued offensive actions along the Svatove-Kreminna line on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian attack near Stelmakhivka, 15km west of Svatove.[15] Russian milbloggers circulated footage reportedly of elements of the 3rd Motor Rifle Division (20th Combined Arms Army, Western Military District) correcting artillery strikes in an unidentified sector of the Svatove-Kreminna line.[16] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Central Military District elements are operating in the Lyman direction (the area west of Kreminna) and using TOS-1 thermobaric multiple rocket launch systems.[17] The commitment of a military district-level asset such as the TOS-1 to the Kreminna area suggests that the Russian MoD is prioritizing this axis. Widely circulated social media footage posted on February 9 additionally shows a Ukrainian strike on a Russian BMPT Terminator armored fighting vehicle about 8km south of Kreminna, indicating that the Russian command is committing new equipment to this area of the front.[18] The Ukrainian General Staff noted that Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian attack near Bilohorivka.[19] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian troops are conducting offensive operations north of Bilohorivka and attacked along the Shepilove-Dibrova line, about 5km south of Kreminna.[20]\\n\\n\\n\\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #2—Donetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)\\n\\nRussian forces continued ground attacks around Bakhmut on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks on Bakhmut itself; northeast of Bakhmut near Vyimka (22km northeast) and Fedorivka (15km northeast); north of Bakhmut near Krasna Hora (4km north) and Paraskoviivka (5km north); and west of Bakhmut near Ivanviske (5km west) and Chasiv Yar (10km west).[21] A Russian milblogger remarked that Russian troops have recently changed their tactics in the Bakhmut area and are focusing less on frontal assaults on small settlements and more on interdicting Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) into Bakhmut along the E40 Bakhmut-Slovyansk and T0504 Kostyantynivka-Chasiv Yar-Bakhmut highways.[22] This observation is consistent with the Ukrainian General Staff report of Russian attacks towards Chasiv Yar and Ivanivske, both critical settlements along the T0504. Other Russian milbloggers similarly claimed that Wagner Group forces are pushing towards Ivanivske and attacking along the E40 near Orikhovo-Vasylivka (10km northwest of Bakhmut) and Dubovo-Vasylivka (5km northwest of Bakhmut).[23] Russian sources claimed that Wagner Group forces are additionally attacking toward Krasna Hora from three sides and that Ukrainian troops are close to withdrawing from the settlement.[24]\\n\\nRussian forces conducted limited ground attacks in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Avdiivka, north of Avdiivka near Novokalynove, and along the western outskirts of Donetsk City near Vodyane, Pervomaiske, Vesele, Krasnohorivka, and Marinka.[25] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City resumed offensives near Krasnohorivka, advanced near Vodyane and Opytne, failed to break through near Pervomaiske, and continued attacks in western Marinka.[26] Social media footage published on February 9 purportedly shows elements of the 5th Brigade of the 1st Army Corps (forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic) attacking Ukrainian positions near Marinka.[27]\\n\\nRussian forces conducted limited ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Bohoyavlenka (25km southwest of Donetsk City) and Prechystivka (38km southwest of Donetsk City).[28] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces resumed assault operations on the outskirts of Vuhledar.[29] A Ukrainian reserve officer also reported that the majority ethnic Tatar volunteer battalion \"Alga\" of the 72nd Motorized Rifle Brigade (3rdArmy Corps) fought near Vuhledar on February 6.[30] The reserve officer suggested that the use of volunteer battalions in this area indicates that the 155th and 40th Naval Infantry Brigades, which were previously active in the area, sustained insurmountable losses and are being replaced by other formations.[31] Recently posted footage from the Vuhledar area shows a defeated Russian mechanized formation of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade that lost 13 main battle tanks and 12 BMP infantry fighting vehicles in a single engagement - about half a Russian tank battalion.[32] The footage shows the Russian formation driving in a column displaying poor tactics and a lack of learning from previous Russian tactical failures.[33] Separate drone footage published on February 8 shows Ukrainian forces striking Russian forces approaching Vuhledar.[34] Geolocated footage published February 7 also shows reported elements of the 36th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade (29th Combined Arms Army, Eastern Military District) striking Ukrainian positions on the eastern outskirts of Vuhledar.[35]\\n\\n\\n\\nSupporting Effort—Southern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\\n\\nRussian forces conducted a limited ground attack in Zaporizhia Oblast on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault near Novoandriivka, Zaporizhia Oblast.[36] Russian forces additionally continued routine fire west of Hulyaipole and in Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson oblasts on February 9.[37] Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces struck Kherson City and Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.[38]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\\n\\nRussian sources claimed that the Russian military integrated a Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) volunteer formation into the Russian Armed Forces. A Russian milblogger claimed that the former DNR Vostok volunteer battalion is now formally the 11th Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces.[39] The DNR Vostok volunteer battalion commander, a notable Russian milblogger, has not addressed the reported integration. The Russian milblogger did not specify what higher formation the 11th regiment is subordinated to, but it is possible that it is subordinated to the Southern Military District which formally controls the DNR 1st Army Corps. This regiment may be assigned to a new unspecified Russian maneuver division. ISW previously assessed that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) appears to be rushing to integrate irregular conventional forces into more traditional structures and will likely struggle to correct these formations‘ poor effectiveness during integration efforts.[40]\\n\\nA Russian military court reportedly ruled that Russian commanders can legally refuse to release servicemembers from service at the end of their contracts. A Russian media outlet reported on February 8 that a Perm Oblast military garrison court ruled in favor of Russian commanders in a lawsuit filed by a serviceman who claimed that the commanders refused to release him from service when his contract ended in September 2022.[41] The court reportedly argued that the partial mobilization decree established an exhaustive list of grounds for release that did not include the expiration of a contract, and therefore, concluded that there were no grounds for recognizing the actions of the commanders as illegal.[42] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin will not formally rescind the partial mobilization decree to legally justify the continued service of mobilized personnel indefinitely.\\n\\nA volunteer battalion affiliated with a Russian occupation official reportedly deployed to frontline positions in Ukraine. Zaporizhia Oblast occupation deputy Vladimir Rogov claimed on February 9 that elements of Zaporizhia Oblast occupation head Yevgeny Balitsky’s Sudaplatov volunteer battalion have deployed to frontline positions in an unspecified area of Ukraine.[43] Russian sources have previously claimed that Turkish, Swedish, and Serbian volunteers are serving in the volunteer battalion.[44] ISW continues to assess that this volunteer battalion will likely face significant command and control challenges if these claims are true.\\n\\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to prioritize the development of occupied territories in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with the Supervisory Board of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives on February 9 and instructed the agency to focus on the development and implementation of socio-economic development plans for occupied Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts.[45] Putin stated that Russia needs to develop the occupied territories within the current decade to foster social commitment to Russia.[46] Donetsk People’s Republic head Denis Pushilin met with Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov on February 9 to discuss a new fuel and energy complex in Donetsk Oblast.[47] The Kremlin and Russian occupation officials likely believe that rapid economic development will promote widespread pro-Russian sentiments in occupied territories.\\n\\nRussian officials continue to pursue the deportation of residents and children from occupied territories through various schemes. Zaporizhia Oblast occupation head Yevgeny Balitsky stated on February 9 that Russian medical services are taking women and newborns with diseases that cannot be treated in Zaporizhia Oblast to Russia for perinatal care.[48] Balitsky also stated that Russian doctors and the Russian Ministry of Health are providing obstetric services in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[49] Both these obstetric measures are likely meant to support ongoing Russian efforts to deport children and residents from occupied territories under the guise of medical relocation schemes.[50] Russian Agency for Strategic Initiatives member Svetlana Chupsheva stated in a meeting with Putin that the agency helped relocate dozens of residents from occupied territories to Russia under the medical relocation scheme.[51] Chupsheva also stated that the Agency for Strategic Initiatives plans to accept 5,000 children from Donetsk Oblast into a programming course that may set conditions for the relocation of these children to Russia.[52] ISW continues to assess that these schemes are likely part of a wider ethnic cleansing effort.\\n\\nRussian sources claimed on February 9 that Russian authorities detained members of a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group attempting to assassinate the Berdyansk deputy occupation head, the Berdyansk occupation traffic police deputy head, and the Berdyansk occupation commandant.[53] Russian sources also claimed that the Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group was preparing an attack on a \"We are Together with Russia\" Center near Berdyansk.[54] ISW has previously assessed that the Kremlin likely founded, coordinates, and promotes the \"We Are Together with Russia\" organization to create a facade of public support for the annexation and integration of occupied Ukrainian oblasts into Russia.[55]\\n\\nSignificant activity in Belarus (ISW assesses that a Russian or Belarusian attack into northern Ukraine in early 2023 is extraordinarily unlikely and has thus restructured this section of the update. It will no longer include counter-indicators for such an offensive.\\n\\nISW will continue to report daily observed Russian and Belarusian military activity in Belarus, but these are not indicators that Russian and Belarusian forces are preparing for an imminent attack on Ukraine from Belarus. ISW will revise this text and its assessment if it observes any unambiguous indicators that Russia or Belarus is preparing to attack northern Ukraine.)\\n\\nBelarusian maneuver elements continue conducting exercises in Belarus. Unspecified elements of the Belarusian 6th Separate Guards Mechanized brigade conducted tactical live-fire exercises at the Gozhsky Training Ground in Grodno, Belarus, on February 9.[56] A tank battalion of the Belarusian 11th Separate Mechanized Brigade conducted live fire training with T-72 tanks at the Obuz-Lesnovsky Training Ground in Brest, Belarus, on February 9.[57]\\n\\nBelarus reportedly began a month-long training for reserve recruits on February 9. The Grey Zone Telegram channel reported on February 9 that Belarus’ reserve recruits began a one-month-long training period.[58]\\n\\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

      "Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin announced on February 9 that the Wagner Group has entirely stopped recruiting prisoners. In a response to a press comment, Prigozhin claimed that Wagner’s recruitment of prisoners has \"completely stopped\" and that \"all obligations are being fulfilled\" for those currently under Wagner’s employ.[1] Prigozhin also absurdly claimed that over 10 million Americans have applied to join Wagner.[2] The Wagner Group will likely continue to recruit from prisons, albeit in a much more limited capacity. As ISW has previously noted, Wagner’s recruitment of prisoners has slowed over the last few months, an assessment confirmed by statistics by the Federal Penitentiary Service that show that decreases in the Russian prison population stabilized between November 2022 and January 2023.[3] This phenomenon is consistent with the overall trend of conventional Russian troops slowly replacing the Wagner Group around Bakhmut, indicating that Russian military command may be shifting away from its reliance on Wagner and therefore on using prisoners as cannon fodder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kremlin continues to pursue measures to gradually prepare Russia’s defense-industrial base for a protracted war in Ukraine while avoiding wider economic mobilization. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with the Supervisory Board of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives on February 9 and instructed the agency to support federal subjects in developing the production of unmanned aircraft systems.[4] Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev previously stated that Russian military manufacturers intend to expand the supply of reconnaissance and attack drones to support operations in Ukraine, and Russian and Iranian officials are reportedly planning to build a factory in Russia to manufacture 6,000 drones \"in the coming years.\"[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "Medvedev visited a tank manufacturing plant in Omsk Oblast on February 9 and stated that Russia needs to increase the production of various armaments, including modern tanks, in response to Western military assistance to Ukraine.[6] Dutch open-source group Oryx reported that Russian forces have lost 1,012 destroyed tanks in Ukraine with an additional 546 tanks captured by Ukrainian forces.[7] Oryx reported that these combined losses represent roughly half the tanks that Russian forces committed to Ukraine at the start of the invasion.[8] Fifteen hundred tanks are enough to equip more than 15 tank regiments or brigades or about 150 battalion tactical groups.[9] The Russian military needs to quickly replenish these tank losses to maintain the ability to conduct large-scale mechanized maneuver warfare ahead of a likely increased pace of offensive operations in eastern Ukraine. Medvedev likely framed his calls for increased production as a response to Western military assistance to obscure the fact that substantial military equipment losses are driving the need for increased production. The Kremlin’s efforts to gradually prepare Russia’s defense industrial base for a protracted war while avoiding a wider mobilization of the Russian economy continue to be incompatible with the scale of the war that the Russian military is fighting in Ukraine and the scale of Russian military equipment losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prominent Wagner-linked Russian milblogger called for the dismissal of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu over a Russian military uniform procurement scandal. Many prominent Russian military bloggers harshly criticized Shoigu and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) over news that the 22-year-old son of the Russian Deputy Head of the Federal Agency for State Property Management won a contract to supply the Russian military with new uniforms.[10] The milbloggers argued that the new uniforms are of inferior quality and overpriced (costing about 130,000-210,000 rubles or $1,780 - $2,875 per uniform) and are part of a petty corruption scheme to enrich the families of Russian defense officials. The Grey Zone Telegram channel—a prominent Wagner Group-affiliated milblogger – wrote an explicative-laden rant to its 426,000 subscribers that Shoigu has lost credibility in front of the Russian nation and that Russian President Vladimir Putin can amend the situation by firing Shoigu, Shoigu’s \"entourage\" in the Russian General Staff and banning Shoigu and his associates from all Russian military affairs.[11] This is the latest episode in a string of events that has prompted Russian military blogger communities to attack the Russian MoD and senior Kremlin officials for petty corruption and ineptitude resulting in battlefield failures and worse quality of life for average Russian soldiers.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kremlin continues to show that it is unwilling to curb divisive rhetoric from ultranationalist pro-war figures. Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov publicly sparred with Duma Deputy General Viktor Sobolev following Sobolev’s criticism of Kadyrov’s statements on grooming standards in the Russian military being discriminatory against Muslims and calls for the Russian military to fight satanism in Poland.[13] Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on February 9 that the Kremlin is \"not participating in this controversy and would not like to give any assessments\" about it.[14] The Kremlin will continue to tolerate divisive rhetoric from ultranationalist figures as it seeks to appeal to the wider pro-war community.\n",

      "Russian forces continued offensive actions along the Svatove-Kreminna line on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian attack near Stelmakhivka, 15km west of Svatove.[15] Russian milbloggers circulated footage reportedly of elements of the 3rd Motor Rifle Division (20th Combined Arms Army, Western Military District) correcting artillery strikes in an unidentified sector of the Svatove-Kreminna line.[16] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Central Military District elements are operating in the Lyman direction (the area west of Kreminna) and using TOS-1 thermobaric multiple rocket launch systems.[17] The commitment of a military district-level asset such as the TOS-1 to the Kreminna area suggests that the Russian MoD is prioritizing this axis. Widely circulated social media footage posted on February 9 additionally shows a Ukrainian strike on a Russian BMPT Terminator armored fighting vehicle about 8km south of Kreminna, indicating that the Russian command is committing new equipment to this area of the front.[18] The Ukrainian General Staff noted that Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian attack near Bilohorivka.[19] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian troops are conducting offensive operations north of Bilohorivka and attacked along the Shepilove-Dibrova line, about 5km south of Kreminna.[20]\n",

      "Russian forces continued ground attacks around Bakhmut on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks on Bakhmut itself; northeast of Bakhmut near Vyimka (22km northeast) and Fedorivka (15km northeast); north of Bakhmut near Krasna Hora (4km north) and Paraskoviivka (5km north); and west of Bakhmut near Ivanviske (5km west) and Chasiv Yar (10km west).[21] A Russian milblogger remarked that Russian troops have recently changed their tactics in the Bakhmut area and are focusing less on frontal assaults on small settlements and more on interdicting Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) into Bakhmut along the E40 Bakhmut-Slovyansk and T0504 Kostyantynivka-Chasiv Yar-Bakhmut highways.[22] This observation is consistent with the Ukrainian General Staff report of Russian attacks towards Chasiv Yar and Ivanivske, both critical settlements along the T0504. Other Russian milbloggers similarly claimed that Wagner Group forces are pushing towards Ivanivske and attacking along the E40 near Orikhovo-Vasylivka (10km northwest of Bakhmut) and Dubovo-Vasylivka (5km northwest of Bakhmut).[23] Russian sources claimed that Wagner Group forces are additionally attacking toward Krasna Hora from three sides and that Ukrainian troops are close to withdrawing from the settlement.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian forces conducted limited ground attacks in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Avdiivka, north of Avdiivka near Novokalynove, and along the western outskirts of Donetsk City near Vodyane, Pervomaiske, Vesele, Krasnohorivka, and Marinka.[25] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City resumed offensives near Krasnohorivka, advanced near Vodyane and Opytne, failed to break through near Pervomaiske, and continued attacks in western Marinka.[26] Social media footage published on February 9 purportedly shows elements of the 5th Brigade of the 1st Army Corps (forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic) attacking Ukrainian positions near Marinka.[27]\n",

      "Russian forces conducted limited ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Bohoyavlenka (25km southwest of Donetsk City) and Prechystivka (38km southwest of Donetsk City).[28] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces resumed assault operations on the outskirts of Vuhledar.[29] A Ukrainian reserve officer also reported that the majority ethnic Tatar volunteer battalion \"Alga\" of the 72nd Motorized Rifle Brigade (3rdArmy Corps) fought near Vuhledar on February 6.[30] The reserve officer suggested that the use of volunteer battalions in this area indicates that the 155th and 40th Naval Infantry Brigades, which were previously active in the area, sustained insurmountable losses and are being replaced by other formations.[31] Recently posted footage from the Vuhledar area shows a defeated Russian mechanized formation of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade that lost 13 main battle tanks and 12 BMP infantry fighting vehicles in a single engagement - about half a Russian tank battalion.[32] The footage shows the Russian formation driving in a column displaying poor tactics and a lack of learning from previous Russian tactical failures.[33] Separate drone footage published on February 8 shows Ukrainian forces striking Russian forces approaching Vuhledar.[34] Geolocated footage published February 7 also shows reported elements of the 36th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade (29th Combined Arms Army, Eastern Military District) striking Ukrainian positions on the eastern outskirts of Vuhledar.[35]\n",

A Russian milblogger claimed that the former DNR Vostok volunteer battalion is now formally the 11th Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces.[39] The DNR Vostok volunteer battalion commander, a notable Russian milblogger, has not addressed the reported integration. The Russian milblogger did not specify what higher formation the 11th regiment is subordinated to, but it is possible that it is subordinated to the Southern Military District which formally controls the DNR 1st Army Corps. This regiment may be assigned to a new unspecified Russian maneuver division. ISW previously assessed that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) appears to be rushing to integrate irregular conventional forces into more traditional structures and will likely struggle to correct these formations‘ poor effectiveness during integration efforts.[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "A Russian military court reportedly ruled that Russian commanders can legally refuse to release servicemembers from service at the end of their contracts. A Russian media outlet reported on February 8 that a Perm Oblast military garrison court ruled in favor of Russian commanders in a lawsuit filed by a serviceman who claimed that the commanders refused to release him from service when his contract ended in September 2022.[41] The court reportedly argued that the partial mobilization decree established an exhaustive list of grounds for release that did not include the expiration of a contract, and therefore, concluded that there were no grounds for recognizing the actions of the commanders as illegal.[42] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin will not formally rescind the partial mobilization decree to legally justify the continued service of mobilized personnel indefinitely.\n",

      "A volunteer battalion affiliated with a Russian occupation official reportedly deployed to frontline positions in Ukraine. Zaporizhia Oblast occupation deputy Vladimir Rogov claimed on February 9 that elements of Zaporizhia Oblast occupation head Yevgeny Balitsky’s Sudaplatov volunteer battalion have deployed to frontline positions in an unspecified area of Ukraine.[43] Russian sources have previously claimed that Turkish, Swedish, and Serbian volunteers are serving in the volunteer battalion.[44] ISW continues to assess that this volunteer battalion will likely face significant command and control challenges if these claims are true.\n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin met with the Supervisory Board of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives on February 9 and instructed the agency to focus on the development and implementation of socio-economic development plans for occupied Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts.[45] Putin stated that Russia needs to develop the occupied territories within the current decade to foster social commitment to Russia.[46] Donetsk People’s Republic head Denis Pushilin met with Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov on February 9 to discuss a new fuel and energy complex in Donetsk Oblast.[47] The Kremlin and Russian occupation officials likely believe that rapid economic development will promote widespread pro-Russian sentiments in occupied territories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian officials continue to pursue the deportation of residents and children from occupied territories through various schemes. Zaporizhia Oblast occupation head Yevgeny Balitsky stated on February 9 that Russian medical services are taking women and newborns with diseases that cannot be treated in Zaporizhia Oblast to Russia for perinatal care.[48] Balitsky also stated that Russian doctors and the Russian Ministry of Health are providing obstetric services in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[49] Both these obstetric measures are likely meant to support ongoing Russian efforts to deport children and residents from occupied territories under the guise of medical relocation schemes.[50] Russian Agency for Strategic Initiatives member Svetlana Chupsheva stated in a meeting with Putin that the agency helped relocate dozens of residents from occupied territories to Russia under the medical relocation scheme.[51] Chupsheva also stated that the Agency for Strategic Initiatives plans to accept 5,000 children from Donetsk Oblast into a programming course that may set conditions for the relocation of these children to Russia.[52] ISW continues to assess that these schemes are likely part of a wider ethnic cleansing effort.\n",

      "Russian sources claimed on February 9 that Russian authorities detained members of a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group attempting to assassinate the Berdyansk deputy occupation head, the Berdyansk occupation traffic police deputy head, and the Berdyansk occupation commandant.[53] Russian sources also claimed that the Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group was preparing an attack on a \"We are Together with Russia\" Center near Berdyansk.[54] ISW has previously assessed that the Kremlin likely founded, coordinates, and promotes the \"We Are Together with Russia\" organization to create a facade of public support for the annexation and integration of occupied Ukrainian oblasts into Russia.[55]\n",

Kagan\\n\\nFebruary 9, 7:30 pm ET\\n\\nClick here to see ISW’s interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\\n\\nWagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin announced on February 9 that the Wagner Group has entirely stopped recruiting prisoners. In a response to a press comment, Prigozhin claimed that Wagner’s recruitment of prisoners has \"completely stopped\" and that \"all obligations are being fulfilled\" for those currently under Wagner’s employ.[1] Prigozhin also absurdly claimed that over 10 million Americans have applied to join Wagner.[2] The Wagner Group will likely continue to recruit from prisons, albeit in a much more limited capacity. As ISW has previously noted, Wagner’s recruitment of prisoners has slowed over the last few months, an assessment confirmed by statistics by the Federal Penitentiary Service that show that decreases in the Russian prison population stabilized between November 2022 and January 2023.[3] This phenomenon is consistent with the overall trend of conventional Russian troops slowly replacing the Wagner Group around Bakhmut, indicating that Russian military command may be shifting away from its reliance on Wagner and therefore on using prisoners as cannon fodder.\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to pursue measures to gradually prepare Russia’s defense-industrial base for a protracted war in Ukraine while avoiding wider economic mobilization. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with the Supervisory Board of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives on February 9 and instructed the agency to support federal subjects in developing the production of unmanned aircraft systems.[4] Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev previously stated that Russian military manufacturers intend to expand the supply of reconnaissance and attack drones to support operations in Ukraine, and Russian and Iranian officials are reportedly planning to build a factory in Russia to manufacture 6,000 drones \"in the coming years.\"[5]\\n\\nMedvedev visited a tank manufacturing plant in Omsk Oblast on February 9 and stated that Russia needs to increase the production of various armaments, including modern tanks, in response to Western military assistance to Ukraine.[6] Dutch open-source group Oryx reported that Russian forces have lost 1,012 destroyed tanks in Ukraine with an additional 546 tanks captured by Ukrainian forces.[7] Oryx reported that these combined losses represent roughly half the tanks that Russian forces committed to Ukraine at the start of the invasion.[8] Fifteen hundred tanks are enough to equip more than 15 tank regiments or brigades or about 150 battalion tactical groups.[9] The Russian military needs to quickly replenish these tank losses to maintain the ability to conduct large-scale mechanized maneuver warfare ahead of a likely increased pace of offensive operations in eastern Ukraine. Medvedev likely framed his calls for increased production as a response to Western military assistance to obscure the fact that substantial military equipment losses are driving the need for increased production. The Kremlin’s efforts to gradually prepare Russia’s defense industrial base for a protracted war while avoiding a wider mobilization of the Russian economy continue to be incompatible with the scale of the war that the Russian military is fighting in Ukraine and the scale of Russian military equipment losses.\\n\\nA prominent Wagner-linked Russian milblogger called for the dismissal of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu over a Russian military uniform procurement scandal. Many prominent Russian military bloggers harshly criticized Shoigu and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) over news that the 22-year-old son of the Russian Deputy Head of the Federal Agency for State Property Management won a contract to supply the Russian military with new uniforms.[10] The milbloggers argued that the new uniforms are of inferior quality and overpriced (costing about 130,000-210,000 rubles or $1,780 - $2,875 per uniform) and are part of a petty corruption scheme to enrich the families of Russian defense officials. The Grey Zone Telegram channel—a prominent Wagner Group-affiliated milblogger – wrote an explicative-laden rant to its 426,000 subscribers that Shoigu has lost credibility in front of the Russian nation and that Russian President Vladimir Putin can amend the situation by firing Shoigu, Shoigu’s \"entourage\" in the Russian General Staff and banning Shoigu and his associates from all Russian military affairs.[11] This is the latest episode in a string of events that has prompted Russian military blogger communities to attack the Russian MoD and senior Kremlin officials for petty corruption and ineptitude resulting in battlefield failures and worse quality of life for average Russian soldiers.[12]\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to show that it is unwilling to curb divisive rhetoric from ultranationalist pro-war figures. Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov publicly sparred with Duma Deputy General Viktor Sobolev following Sobolev’s criticism of Kadyrov’s statements on grooming standards in the Russian military being discriminatory against Muslims and calls for the Russian military to fight satanism in Poland.[13] Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on February 9 that the Kremlin is \"not participating in this controversy and would not like to give any assessments\" about it.[14] The Kremlin will continue to tolerate divisive rhetoric from ultranationalist figures as it seeks to appeal to the wider pro-war community.\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nWagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin announced that the Wagner Group has entirely stopped recruiting prisoners.\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to pursue measures to gradually prepare Russia’s defense industrial base for a protracted war in Ukraine.\\n\\nA prominent Wagner-linked Russian milblogger called for the dismissal of Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu over a Russian military uniform procurement scandal.\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to illustrate that it is unwilling to curb divisive rhetoric from ultranationalist pro-war figures.\\n\\nRussian forces continued offensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line.\\n\\nRussian forces conducted limited ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast and the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area and continued offensive operations around Bakhmut.\\n\\nRussian forces conducted a limited ground attack in Zaporizhia Oblast.\\n\\nRussian sources claimed that the Russian military integrated a Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) volunteer formation into the Russian Armed Forces.\\n\\nRussian sources claimed that Russian authorities detained a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group attempting to assassinate Russian occupation officials.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\\n\\nRussian Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine (comprised of two subordinate main efforts)\\n\\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #1—Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and encircle northern Donetsk Oblast\\n\\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #2—Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\\n\\nRussian Supporting Effort—Southern Axis\\n\\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\\n\\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\\n\\nRussian Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine\\n\\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #1- Luhansk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and continue offensive operations into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and northern Donetsk Oblast)\\n\\nISW continues to assess that Russia\\'s most likely course of action (MLCOA) is an imminent offensive effort in Luhansk Oblast and is therefore adjusting the structure of the daily campaign assessments. We will no longer include the Eastern Kharkiv and Western Luhansk Oblast area as part of Ukrainian counteroffensives and will assess this area as a subordinate part of the Russian main effort in Eastern Ukraine. The assessment of Luhansk Oblast as part of the Russian main effort does not preclude the possibility of continued Ukrainian counteroffensive actions here or anywhere else in theater in the future. ISW will report on Ukrainian counteroffensive efforts as they occur.\\n\\nRussian forces continued offensive actions along the Svatove-Kreminna line on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian attack near Stelmakhivka, 15km west of Svatove.[15] Russian milbloggers circulated footage reportedly of elements of the 3rd Motor Rifle Division (20th Combined Arms Army, Western Military District) correcting artillery strikes in an unidentified sector of the Svatove-Kreminna line.[16] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Central Military District elements are operating in the Lyman direction (the area west of Kreminna) and using TOS-1 thermobaric multiple rocket launch systems.[17] The commitment of a military district-level asset such as the TOS-1 to the Kreminna area suggests that the Russian MoD is prioritizing this axis. Widely circulated social media footage posted on February 9 additionally shows a Ukrainian strike on a Russian BMPT Terminator armored fighting vehicle about 8km south of Kreminna, indicating that the Russian command is committing new equipment to this area of the front.[18] The Ukrainian General Staff noted that Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian attack near Bilohorivka.[19] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian troops are conducting offensive operations north of Bilohorivka and attacked along the Shepilove-Dibrova line, about 5km south of Kreminna.[20]\\n\\n\\n\\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #2—Donetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)\\n\\nRussian forces continued ground attacks around Bakhmut on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks on Bakhmut itself; northeast of Bakhmut near Vyimka (22km northeast) and Fedorivka (15km northeast); north of Bakhmut near Krasna Hora (4km north) and Paraskoviivka (5km north); and west of Bakhmut near Ivanviske (5km west) and Chasiv Yar (10km west).[21] A Russian milblogger remarked that Russian troops have recently changed their tactics in the Bakhmut area and are focusing less on frontal assaults on small settlements and more on interdicting Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) into Bakhmut along the E40 Bakhmut-Slovyansk and T0504 Kostyantynivka-Chasiv Yar-Bakhmut highways.[22] This observation is consistent with the Ukrainian General Staff report of Russian attacks towards Chasiv Yar and Ivanivske, both critical settlements along the T0504. Other Russian milbloggers similarly claimed that Wagner Group forces are pushing towards Ivanivske and attacking along the E40 near Orikhovo-Vasylivka (10km northwest of Bakhmut) and Dubovo-Vasylivka (5km northwest of Bakhmut).[23] Russian sources claimed that Wagner Group forces are additionally attacking toward Krasna Hora from three sides and that Ukrainian troops are close to withdrawing from the settlement.[24]\\n\\nRussian forces conducted limited ground attacks in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Avdiivka, north of Avdiivka near Novokalynove, and along the western outskirts of Donetsk City near Vodyane, Pervomaiske, Vesele, Krasnohorivka, and Marinka.[25] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City resumed offensives near Krasnohorivka, advanced near Vodyane and Opytne, failed to break through near Pervomaiske, and continued attacks in western Marinka.[26] Social media footage published on February 9 purportedly shows elements of the 5th Brigade of the 1st Army Corps (forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic) attacking Ukrainian positions near Marinka.[27]\\n\\nRussian forces conducted limited ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Bohoyavlenka (25km southwest of Donetsk City) and Prechystivka (38km southwest of Donetsk City).[28] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces resumed assault operations on the outskirts of Vuhledar.[29] A Ukrainian reserve officer also reported that the majority ethnic Tatar volunteer battalion \"Alga\" of the 72nd Motorized Rifle Brigade (3rdArmy Corps) fought near Vuhledar on February 6.[30] The reserve officer suggested that the use of volunteer battalions in this area indicates that the 155th and 40th Naval Infantry Brigades, which were previously active in the area, sustained insurmountable losses and are being replaced by other formations.[31] Recently posted footage from the Vuhledar area shows a defeated Russian mechanized formation of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade that lost 13 main battle tanks and 12 BMP infantry fighting vehicles in a single engagement - about half a Russian tank battalion.[32] The footage shows the Russian formation driving in a column displaying poor tactics and a lack of learning from previous Russian tactical failures.[33] Separate drone footage published on February 8 shows Ukrainian forces striking Russian forces approaching Vuhledar.[34] Geolocated footage published February 7 also shows reported elements of the 36th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade (29th Combined Arms Army, Eastern Military District) striking Ukrainian positions on the eastern outskirts of Vuhledar.[35]\\n\\n\\n\\nSupporting Effort—Southern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\\n\\nRussian forces conducted a limited ground attack in Zaporizhia Oblast on February 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault near Novoandriivka, Zaporizhia Oblast.[36] Russian forces additionally continued routine fire west of Hulyaipole and in Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson oblasts on February 9.[37] Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces struck Kherson City and Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.[38]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\\n\\nRussian sources claimed that the Russian military integrated a Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) volunteer formation into the Russian Armed Forces. A Russian milblogger claimed that the former DNR Vostok volunteer battalion is now formally the 11th Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces.[39] The DNR Vostok volunteer battalion commander, a notable Russian milblogger, has not addressed the reported integration. The Russian milblogger did not specify what higher formation the 11th regiment is subordinated to, but it is possible that it is subordinated to the Southern Military District which formally controls the DNR 1st Army Corps. This regiment may be assigned to a new unspecified Russian maneuver division. ISW previously assessed that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) appears to be rushing to integrate irregular conventional forces into more traditional structures and will likely struggle to correct these formations‘ poor effectiveness during integration efforts.[40]\\n\\nA Russian military court reportedly ruled that Russian commanders can legally refuse to release servicemembers from service at the end of their contracts. A Russian media outlet reported on February 8 that a Perm Oblast military garrison court ruled in favor of Russian commanders in a lawsuit filed by a serviceman who claimed that the commanders refused to release him from service when his contract ended in September 2022.[41] The court reportedly argued that the partial mobilization decree established an exhaustive list of grounds for release that did not include the expiration of a contract, and therefore, concluded that there were no grounds for recognizing the actions of the commanders as illegal.[42] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin will not formally rescind the partial mobilization decree to legally justify the continued service of mobilized personnel indefinitely.\\n\\nA volunteer battalion affiliated with a Russian occupation official reportedly deployed to frontline positions in Ukraine. Zaporizhia Oblast occupation deputy Vladimir Rogov claimed on February 9 that elements of Zaporizhia Oblast occupation head Yevgeny Balitsky’s Sudaplatov volunteer battalion have deployed to frontline positions in an unspecified area of Ukraine.[43] Russian sources have previously claimed that Turkish, Swedish, and Serbian volunteers are serving in the volunteer battalion.[44] ISW continues to assess that this volunteer battalion will likely face significant command and control challenges if these claims are true.\\n\\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\\n\\nThe Kremlin continues to prioritize the development of occupied territories in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with the Supervisory Board of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives on February 9 and instructed the agency to focus on the development and implementation of socio-economic development plans for occupied Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts.[45] Putin stated that Russia needs to develop the occupied territories within the current decade to foster social commitment to Russia.[46] Donetsk People’s Republic head Denis Pushilin met with Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov on February 9 to discuss a new fuel and energy complex in Donetsk Oblast.[47] The Kremlin and Russian occupation officials likely believe that rapid economic development will promote widespread pro-Russian sentiments in occupied territories.\\n\\nRussian officials continue to pursue the deportation of residents and children from occupied territories through various schemes. Zaporizhia Oblast occupation head Yevgeny Balitsky stated on February 9 that Russian medical services are taking women and newborns with diseases that cannot be treated in Zaporizhia Oblast to Russia for perinatal care.[48] Balitsky also stated that Russian doctors and the Russian Ministry of Health are providing obstetric services in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[49] Both these obstetric measures are likely meant to support ongoing Russian efforts to deport children and residents from occupied territories under the guise of medical relocation schemes.[50] Russian Agency for Strategic Initiatives member Svetlana Chupsheva stated in a meeting with Putin that the agency helped relocate dozens of residents from occupied territories to Russia under the medical relocation scheme.[51] Chupsheva also stated that the Agency for Strategic Initiatives plans to accept 5,000 children from Donetsk Oblast into a programming course that may set conditions for the relocation of these children to Russia.[52] ISW continues to assess that these schemes are likely part of a wider ethnic cleansing effort.\\n\\nRussian sources claimed on February 9 that Russian authorities detained members of a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group attempting to assassinate the Berdyansk deputy occupation head, the Berdyansk occupation traffic police deputy head, and the Berdyansk occupation commandant.[53] Russian sources also claimed that the Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group was preparing an attack on a \"We are Together with Russia\" Center near Berdyansk.[54] ISW has previously assessed that the Kremlin likely founded, coordinates, and promotes the \"We Are Together with Russia\" organization to create a facade of public support for the annexation and integration of occupied Ukrainian oblasts into Russia.[55]\\n\\nSignificant activity in Belarus (ISW assesses that a Russian or Belarusian attack into northern Ukraine in early 2023 is extraordinarily unlikely and has thus restructured this section of the update. It will no longer include counter-indicators for such an offensive.\\n\\nISW will continue to report daily observed Russian and Belarusian military activity in Belarus, but these are not indicators that Russian and Belarusian forces are preparing for an imminent attack on Ukraine from Belarus. ISW will revise this text and its assessment if it observes any unambiguous indicators that Russia or Belarus is preparing to attack northern Ukraine.)\\n\\nBelarusian maneuver elements continue conducting exercises in Belarus. Unspecified elements of the Belarusian 6th Separate Guards Mechanized brigade conducted tactical live-fire exercises at the Gozhsky Training Ground in Grodno, Belarus, on February 9.[56] A tank battalion of the Belarusian 11th Separate Mechanized Brigade conducted live fire training with T-72 tanks at the Obuz-Lesnovsky Training Ground in Brest, Belarus, on February 9.[57]\\n\\nBelarus reportedly began a month-long training for reserve recruits on February 9. The Grey Zone Telegram channel reported on February 9 that Belarus’ reserve recruits began a one-month-long training period.[58]\\n\\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

These conditions are permanent and incurable, but many are now treatable thanks to medical advances. Currently, the main goal is to treat the symptoms and slow the progress of these conditions when possible.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

These conditions usually develop slowly, and the effects and symptoms tend to appear later in life.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\\n\\nThis term doesn’t just refer to a single type of condition. Instead, it’s an umbrella term that applies to several types of conditions.\\n\\nTypes of this condition\\n\\nSome of the main types of degenerative brain diseases include (but aren’t limited to):\\n\\nDementia-type diseases: These cause progressive damage to various areas of your brain, causing neurons in several areas of your brain, to die. That can then cause a wide range of symptoms depending on brain areas affected. These include many conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Lewy body dementia and limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).\\n\\nDemyelinating diseases: These involve myelin damage or loss, which affects sending and relaying of nerve signals. Examples include multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).\\n\\nParkinsonism-type diseases: These happen because of damage to specific neurons in your brain that help manage coordination and precise control of muscle movements. This includes Parkinson’s disease and other forms of parkinsonism (the general term for conditions that look similar to Parkinson’s).\\n\\nMotor neuron diseases: These happen when neurons that control movement die off. Examples include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, often known as “Lou Gehrig's disease”) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\\n\\nPrion diseases: These are a type of protein misfolding disease that cause serious brain damage in a relatively short time (most people don’t survive more than a year). Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most common, and most cases happen for unknown reasons. It can also be genetic (survival time for these cases is between one and 10 years).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt’s important to remember that there are many areas of overlap between the various degenerative brain diseases. Many of them share symptoms and have causes that work similarly.\\n\\nHow common are degenerative brain diseases?\\n\\nDegenerative brain diseases are uncommon, but happen often enough to be common knowledge. Researchers estimate they affect more than 50 million people worldwide.\\n\\nMost of these conditions are strongly connected to age and are much more likely to happen in people over 65 (but some conditions like Huntington’s disease and ALS often appear earlier). The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that the number of people over 65 will at least double in the next 30 years. That means the number of people with neurodegenerative conditions will also climb at a similar rate.\\n\\nSymptoms and Causes\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases?\\n\\nThe symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases vary widely. Some may have obvious connections to a degenerative brain disease. Other symptoms might seem completely unconnected without specific medical testing.\\n\\nIn general, the different types of conditions cause the following symptoms:\\n\\nDementia-type diseases: These cause confusion, memory loss, trouble thinking or concentrating, and behavior changes.\\n\\nDemyelinating diseases: Common symptoms include tingling or numbness, pain, muscle spasms, weakness and paralysis, coordination issues and fatigue.\\n\\nParkinsonism-type diseases: These often involve slowed movements, shaking and tremors, balance problems, shuffling steps and hunched posture.\\n\\nMotor neuron diseases: These affect parts of your brain and nervous system responsible for muscle control. As the neurons in those areas die, you lose muscle control. That causes weakness and eventually paralysis.\\n\\nWhy can the symptoms vary so much?\\n\\nThe symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases can vary widely, even among people with the same condition. There are a few reasons for this:\\n\\nEach person’s brain is unique. No two brains form or work in exactly the same way. That means the same condition can still affect two people differently.\\n\\nNeurodegenerative diseases happen for many different reasons. The possible causes can vary widely for these conditions, even among conditions of the same type.\\n\\nThe symptoms depend on what’s affected.The parts of your brain or nervous system affected determine the symptoms of these conditions.\\n\\nWhat causes neurodegenerative diseases?\\n\\nSome neurodegenerative diseases have a single cause that healthcare providers can identify. But in many cases, there isn’t a single cause. Instead, research shows multiple factors probably contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. And there are times when providers might not be able to find a cause — which can be frustrating for someone with one of these conditions or their loved ones.\\n\\nSo far, experts have identified dozens of possible causes or risk factors. These tend to fall into a few specific categories, including:\\n\\nAge: This is generally the most important factor in developing neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions have strong ties to age. The older you are, the greater your chances of developing one. Some degenerative brain diseases can start earlier in life, but this is less common.\\n\\nGenetics: Many neurodegenerative diseases have strong ties to family history. That’s often because of specific mutations you can inherit that increase your risk. Spontaneous mutations can also happen, and sometimes a combination of genes plays a role.\\n\\nEnvironment: Your environment can be a major factor in developing these conditions. Exposure to pollution, chemicals and toxins, certain types of infections and even where you live may all play a role (for example, lower vitamin D levels, which are more common the farther you live from the Earth’s equator, have links to dementia-type diseases).\\n\\nMedical history: Your medical history and past health events can all play a role in developing neurodegenerative diseases. Some neurodegenerative conditions can either happen because of specific medical events or can get worse because of them. Some examples include cancer, certain types of infections, if you've had head injuries and more.\\n\\nHabits, routine and choices: Examples include what you eat, how active you are, whether or not you use tobacco products, how much alcohol you consume and many more.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhat are the complications of neurodegenerative diseases?\\n\\nComplications are common with neurodegenerative diseases because these diseases damage parts of your brain and nervous system. As the damage worsens, you lose the abilities that the damaged areas once controlled. Some examples of this include:\\n\\nMovement disorders affect your strength, flexibility, agility and reflexes. When those decrease, your risk of falls and fractures increases.\\n\\nMotor neuron disorders cause gradual paralysis. When this affects muscles that control breathing, it increases the risk of pneumonia and other respiratory conditions.\\n\\nDementia-type diseases affect memory, judgment and thinking. As these worsen, people typically can’t live independently anymore because of risks to their health and safety.\\n\\nDiagnosis and Tests\\n\\nHow is it diagnosed?\\n\\nDiagnosing a neurodegenerative disease varies depending on the condition you have. Healthcare providers can start with a simple neurological exam and by asking you or your loved ones questions about your symptoms and medical history.\\n\\nOther conditions are diagnosable with specific tests. Some of these include:\\n\\nLaboratory testing: Blood tests and genetic testing are sometimes all it takes to diagnose certain neurodegenerative conditions.\\n\\nImaging scans: Computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans) and other imaging tests are often very important in diagnosing these conditions. They allow healthcare providers to “see” your brain and determine if there’s damage or changes that indicate you have a neurodegenerative condition, or to rule out other causes.\\n\\nHistopathology (microscopic tissue analysis) after death: Some neurodegenerative conditions, such as Pick’s disease or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, aren’t diagnosable while you’re alive. Healthcare providers can suspect this condition while you’re alive, but the only way to confirm the diagnosis for certain is to look at samples of your brain under a microscope after an autopsy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOther tests are also possible depending on the condition you have or the symptoms you show. These can vary widely because they depend on what area of your brain they affect. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what tests they recommend in your situation and why.\\n\\nManagement and Treatment\\n\\nHow are neurodegenerative diseases treated, and is there a cure?\\n\\nUnfortunately, all neurodegenerative diseases are incurable. These diseases destroy brain cells, which is impossible to reverse.\\n\\nSome neurodegenerative diseases are treatable, depending on why they happen. Some of these conditions are treatable directly, so you may be able to manage, limit or slow their effects. Other conditions aren’t treatable directly, but it might be possible to treat the symptoms and improve your quality of life.\\n\\nBecause the treatments can vary so widely, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what treatments are possible and which they recommend. The information they provide will be the most relevant and accurate because it also considers the details of your situation, your medical history and more. They can also tell you about the side effects and complications you might experience, what to watch for and any other considerations.\\n\\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nNeurology Care for Adults\\n\\nNeurology Care for Children\\n\\nMake an Appointment\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nCan this be prevented?\\n\\nNeurodegenerative diseases happen unpredictably. Most of them happen for reasons that aren’t fully understood. Because of both those facts, they aren’t preventable.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHow can I lower my risk?\\n\\nWhile neurodegenerative diseases aren’t preventable, there are things you can do to lower your risk of developing one. Because these diseases are often due to a combination of factors, reducing the number of factors may help lower your risk.\\n\\nSteps you can take to reduce your risk include:\\n\\nEat a balanced diet. Your diet affects your brain health. A poor diet can make your brain more vulnerable to developing a neurodegenerative disorder. It can also make other conditions that could contribute (such as stroke) more likely to happen.\\n\\nStay physically active and maintain a healthy weight. Your weight and activity level also affect your brain. Weight-related conditions and concerns, especially circulatory problems like high blood pressure and metabolic conditions like Type 2 diabetes, can also contribute.\\n\\nWear safety equipment as needed.Head injuries, especially concussions and traumatic brain injuries, can strongly increase your risk of a neurodegenerative disorder. That makes safety equipment invaluable to preventing injury and protecting your brain health in the long run.\\n\\nSee your primary care provider annually. This can help avoid or delay chronic medical conditions that might later contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. These visits may also help detect neurodegenerative diseases earlier. That’s helpful because many of these conditions are much more treatable in their earlier stages.\\n\\nOutlook / Prognosis\\n\\nWhat can I expect if I have a neurodegenerative disease?\\n\\nBecause there are so many different neurodegenerative diseases, what you can expect will vary depending on many factors. Some conditions progress at different rates and may take years or even decades to become severe. Others can worsen faster. As a result, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what you can expect.\\n\\nThe longer you have a neurodegenerative disease, the more likely complications become. Unfortunately, these conditions can lead to a decrease in quality of life, and eventually cause death (or contribute to something else that causes it).\\n\\nHow long do neurodegenerative diseases last?\\n\\nOnce they develop, neurodegenerative diseases are permanent, lifelong conditions.\\n\\nWhat’s the outlook for neurodegenerative diseases?\\n\\nIn general, neurodegenerative diseases will continue to worsen and cause some degree of disability. People with these conditions may be unable to move around without using assistive devices. Others may have trouble thinking or remembering, which eventually means they can’t live independently. It’s common for people with these conditions to need some level of medical care 24/7, such as in a long-term care facility (informally known as a nursing home) or a similar setting.\\n\\nLiving With\\n\\nHow do I take care of myself if I have a neurodegenerative disease?\\n\\nIf you have a neurodegenerative disease, taking care of yourself may be possible early on, but eventually, you’ll need help taking care of yourself. Being able to take care of yourself and how long you can do so depend on many factors, especially the condition you have and if you have any other health issues.\\n\\nMaking choices for when you can’t choose for yourself\\n\\nIf you learn you have a neurodegenerative disease of any kind, it’s important to have conversations with people you trust about what you want if you can’t make choices for yourself. These conversations, while difficult, can ensure they know and follow your wishes. This is a good idea no matter what neurodegenerative condition you have (and a good idea for everyone in general).\\n\\nThe people you should talk about this with include:\\n\\nYour primary healthcare provider and/or any specialists who help manage your condition.\\n\\nYour immediate family.\\n\\nYour attorney (if you have one already).\\n\\nOther extended family, friends or loved ones you trust to make life-or-death decisions for you.\\n\\nThe topics you should talk about with them include:\\n\\nWho you want to speak or make decisions for you, if necessary.\\n\\nFinancial concerns related to paying for your care.\\n\\nYour wishes regarding end-of-life care, a will (living or otherwise), power of attorney, etc.\\n\\nWhat you want for yourself regarding lifesaving or life-prolonging care, etc.\\n\\nThese conversations might feel unpleasant or difficult, but having them sooner rather than later can ensure your loved ones know what you want if you can’t tell them or choose for yourself.\\n\\nIn addition to those conversations, you should also put your wishes and decisions in writing. Consider preparing documents related to legal issues and what happens if you can’t take care of yourself or make decisions for your own care or well-being. You can consult an attorney for help preparing these documents, but many of them you can prepare on your own (you may need a notary or other official to endorse them, depending on the laws in your area).\\n\\nHow do I care for a loved one with a neurodegenerative disease?\\n\\nIf you have a loved one with a neurodegenerative disease, what you can do depends on the condition they have, how advanced it is, other health concerns and more. Your loved one and/or their healthcare provider are the best people to tell you what they might need.\\n\\nIt can be hard for many people with these conditions to talk about what they’re facing. Many people with these conditions fear what’s happening or what might happen in the future. That can make it difficult for them to ask for help. Many feel embarrassed about asking for help or the thought that they might need to rely on others.\\n\\nIf you have a loved one with a neurodegenerative disease, here are some things you can do or keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t treat them like an invalid or burden. Degenerative brain conditions make it hard to do things you used to do easily. Eventually, these conditions can make it hard to do even simple things like bathe, get dressed or go to the bathroom. Treat them with as much dignity and respect as you would anyone. Remember that they’re a person you care about, not the condition they have.\\n\\nAsk what they need. Sometimes, people facing a difficult situation just want to vent. If a loved one opens up to you, it may be helpful to ask if they want a listening ear or if they want feedback, suggestions or assistance.\\n\\nOffer to help. Your loved one may have trouble asking for help. They might not want to ask for help, or might not feel like they need it. Sometimes, helping them with little things can make it easier for them to rely on you for bigger needs. Going with them to medical appointments, assisting with errands or helping with household chores are all ways you can pitch in.\\n\\nTake care of yourself. Caregivers can experience burnout, too. It’s much harder to care for others when you aren’t taking care of yourself. It’s also important to acknowledge when your loved one needs a higher level of care than you can provide. Trying to care for them when you don’t have the training or resources can do more harm than good.\\n\\nWhen should I see my healthcare provider, or when should I seek care?\\n\\nYou should see a healthcare provider anytime you have brain-related symptoms or issues that affect your routine and activities. Early detection of neurodegenerative diseases can make a big difference in delaying how fast the disease worsens.\\n\\nIf you know you have a neurodegenerative disease, you should also seek care when:\\n\\nYour provider has you scheduled for an appointment. Making these appointments helps your provider monitor your condition and recommend adjustments to treatment or lifestyle that might help.\\n\\nYou notice changes in your symptoms. These kinds of changes can be important information for your provider to consider as they work to monitor and care for you.\\n\\nYou notice side effects or changes in treatment effectiveness. Treatments like medication may become less effective with time. Tell your provider if you notice differences in treatment effectiveness. That can also help them adjust your treatment to be more effective and monitor your condition.\\n\\nYour healthcare provider can also tell you about other things to watch for that mean you need to see them soon or that you need medical care right away.\\n\\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nFinding out you have a neurodegenerative disease can make you feel shocked, scared or angry. It can also be troubling to face the idea that you might not be able to take care of yourself and live independently because you have one of these conditions. You may also feel that way if you have a loved one with one of these conditions.\\n\\nWhile neurodegenerative diseases are permanent and incurable, experts and researchers are continuing to uncover new ways to diagnose and treat these conditions. That means healthcare providers can do even more to treat these conditions, give you a chance to live longer and keep your quality of life as high as possible. That way, you can limit how much these conditions affect your life and focus on what matters most to you.\\n\\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nIf you have a neurological condition, you want expert advice.

      "\n",
      "Types of this condition\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the main types of degenerative brain diseases include (but aren’t limited to):\n",
      "\n",
      "Dementia-type diseases: These cause progressive damage to various areas of your brain, causing neurons in several areas of your brain, to die. That can then cause a wide range of symptoms depending on brain areas affected. These include many conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Lewy body dementia and limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).\n",
      "\n",
      "Demyelinating diseases: These involve myelin damage or loss, which affects sending and relaying of nerve signals. Examples include multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).\n",
      "\n",
      "Parkinsonism-type diseases: These happen because of damage to specific neurons in your brain that help manage coordination and precise control of muscle movements. This includes Parkinson’s disease and other forms of parkinsonism (the general term for conditions that look similar to Parkinson’s).\n",
      "\n",
      "Motor neuron diseases: These happen when neurons that control movement die off. Examples include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, often known as “Lou Gehrig's disease”) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\n",
      "\n",
      "Prion diseases: These are a type of protein misfolding disease that cause serious brain damage in a relatively short time (most people don’t survive more than a year). Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most common, and most cases happen for unknown reasons. It can also be genetic (survival time for these cases is between one and 10 years).\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important to remember that there are many areas of overlap between the various degenerative brain diseases. Many of them share symptoms and have causes that work similarly.\n",
      "\n",
      "How common are degenerative brain diseases?\n",
      "\n",
      "Degenerative brain diseases are uncommon, but happen often enough to be common knowledge. Researchers estimate they affect more than 50 million people worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these conditions are strongly connected to age and are much more likely to happen in people over 65 (but some conditions like Huntington’s disease and ALS often appear earlier). The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that the number of people over 65 will at least double in the next 30 years. That means the number of people with neurodegenerative conditions will also climb at a similar rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms and Causes\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases?\n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases vary widely. Some may have obvious connections to a degenerative brain disease. Other symptoms might seem completely unconnected without specific medical testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the different types of conditions cause the following symptoms:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dementia-type diseases: These cause confusion, memory loss, trouble thinking or concentrating, and behavior changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demyelinating diseases: Common symptoms include tingling or numbness, pain, muscle spasms, weakness and paralysis, coordination issues and fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parkinsonism-type diseases: These often involve slowed movements, shaking and tremors, balance problems, shuffling steps and hunched posture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Motor neuron diseases: These affect parts of your brain and nervous system responsible for muscle control. As the neurons in those areas die, you lose muscle control. That causes weakness and eventually paralysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why can the symptoms vary so much?\n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases can vary widely, even among people with the same condition. There are a few reasons for this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Each person’s brain is unique. No two brains form or work in exactly the same way. That means the same condition can still affect two people differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neurodegenerative diseases happen for many different reasons. The possible causes can vary widely for these conditions, even among conditions of the same type.\n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms depend on what’s affected.The parts of your brain or nervous system affected determine the symptoms of these conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes neurodegenerative diseases?\n",
      "\n",
      "Some neurodegenerative diseases have a single cause that healthcare providers can identify. But in many cases, there isn’t a single cause. Instead, research shows multiple factors probably contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. And there are times when providers might not be able to find a cause — which can be frustrating for someone with one of these conditions or their loved ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, experts have identified dozens of possible causes or risk factors. These tend to fall into a few specific categories, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Age: This is generally the most important factor in developing neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions have strong ties to age. The older you are, the greater your chances of developing one. Some degenerative brain diseases can start earlier in life, but this is less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetics: Many neurodegenerative diseases have strong ties to family history. That’s often because of specific mutations you can inherit that increase your risk. Spontaneous mutations can also happen, and sometimes a combination of genes plays a role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment: Your environment can be a major factor in developing these conditions. Exposure to pollution, chemicals and toxins, certain types of infections and even where you live may all play a role (for example, lower vitamin D levels, which are more common the farther you live from the Earth’s equator, have links to dementia-type diseases).\n",
      "\n",
      "Medical history: Your medical history and past health events can all play a role in developing neurodegenerative diseases. Some neurodegenerative conditions can either happen because of specific medical events or can get worse because of them. Some examples include cancer, certain types of infections, if you've had head injuries and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Habits, routine and choices: Examples include what you eat, how active you are, whether or not you use tobacco products, how much alcohol you consume and many more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the complications of neurodegenerative diseases?\n",
      "\n",
      "Complications are common with neurodegenerative diseases because these diseases damage parts of your brain and nervous system. As the damage worsens, you lose the abilities that the damaged areas once controlled. Some examples of this include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Movement disorders affect your strength, flexibility, agility and reflexes. When those decrease, your risk of falls and fractures increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Motor neuron disorders cause gradual paralysis. When this affects muscles that control breathing, it increases the risk of pneumonia and other respiratory conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dementia-type diseases affect memory, judgment and thinking. As these worsen, people typically can’t live independently anymore because of risks to their health and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis and Tests\n",
      "\n",
      "How is it diagnosed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosing a neurodegenerative disease varies depending on the condition you have. Healthcare providers can start with a simple neurological exam and by asking you or your loved ones questions about your symptoms and medical history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other conditions are diagnosable with specific tests. Some of these include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboratory testing: Blood tests and genetic testing are sometimes all it takes to diagnose certain neurodegenerative conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imaging scans: Computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans) and other imaging tests are often very important in diagnosing these conditions.

      "Histopathology (microscopic tissue analysis) after death: Some neurodegenerative conditions, such as Pick’s disease or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, aren’t diagnosable while you’re alive. Healthcare providers can suspect this condition while you’re alive, but the only way to confirm the diagnosis for certain is to look at samples of your brain under a microscope after an autopsy.\n",

      "How are neurodegenerative diseases treated, and is there a cure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, all neurodegenerative diseases are incurable. These diseases destroy brain cells, which is impossible to reverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some neurodegenerative diseases are treatable, depending on why they happen. Some of these conditions are treatable directly, so you may be able to manage, limit or slow their effects. Other conditions aren’t treatable directly, but it might be possible to treat the symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the treatments can vary so widely, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what treatments are possible and which they recommend. The information they provide will be the most relevant and accurate because it also considers the details of your situation, your medical history and more. They can also tell you about the side effects and complications you might experience, what to watch for and any other considerations.\n",

      "\n",
      "While neurodegenerative diseases aren’t preventable, there are things you can do to lower your risk of developing one. Because these diseases are often due to a combination of factors, reducing the number of factors may help lower your risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps you can take to reduce your risk include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Eat a balanced diet. Your diet affects your brain health. A poor diet can make your brain more vulnerable to developing a neurodegenerative disorder. It can also make other conditions that could contribute (such as stroke) more likely to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay physically active and maintain a healthy weight. Your weight and activity level also affect your brain. Weight-related conditions and concerns, especially circulatory problems like high blood pressure and metabolic conditions like Type 2 diabetes, can also contribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wear safety equipment as needed.Head injuries, especially concussions and traumatic brain injuries, can strongly increase your risk of a neurodegenerative disorder. That makes safety equipment invaluable to preventing injury and protecting your brain health in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "See your primary care provider annually. This can help avoid or delay chronic medical conditions that might later contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. These visits may also help detect neurodegenerative diseases earlier. That’s helpful because many of these conditions are much more treatable in their earlier stages.\n",

      "Outlook / Prognosis\n",
      "\n",
      "What can I expect if I have a neurodegenerative disease?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because there are so many different neurodegenerative diseases, what you can expect will vary depending on many factors. Some conditions progress at different rates and may take years or even decades to become severe. Others can worsen faster. As a result, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what you can expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The longer you have a neurodegenerative disease, the more likely complications become. Unfortunately, these conditions can lead to a decrease in quality of life, and eventually cause death (or contribute to something else that causes it).\n",
      "\n",
      "How long do neurodegenerative diseases last?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once they develop, neurodegenerative diseases are permanent, lifelong conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s the outlook for neurodegenerative diseases?\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, neurodegenerative diseases will continue to worsen and cause some degree of disability. People with these conditions may be unable to move around without using assistive devices. Others may have trouble thinking or remembering, which eventually means they can’t live independently. It’s common for people with these conditions to need some level of medical care 24/7, such as in a long-term care facility (informally known as a nursing home) or a similar setting.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you have a neurodegenerative disease, taking care of yourself may be possible early on, but eventually, you’ll need help taking care of yourself. Being able to take care of yourself and how long you can do so depend on many factors, especially the condition you have and if you have any other health issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making choices for when you can’t choose for yourself\n",
      "\n",
      "If you learn you have a neurodegenerative disease of any kind, it’s important to have conversations with people you trust about what you want if you can’t make choices for yourself. These conversations, while difficult, can ensure they know and follow your wishes. This is a good idea no matter what neurodegenerative condition you have (and a good idea for everyone in general).\n",
      "\n",
      "The people you should talk about this with include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Your primary healthcare provider and/or any specialists who help manage your condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your immediate family.\n",
      "\n",

      "The topics you should talk about with them include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Who you want to speak or make decisions for you, if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial concerns related to paying for your care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your wishes regarding end-of-life care, a will (living or otherwise), power of attorney, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you want for yourself regarding lifesaving or life-prolonging care, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "These conversations might feel unpleasant or difficult, but having them sooner rather than later can ensure your loved ones know what you want if you can’t tell them or choose for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to those conversations, you should also put your wishes and decisions in writing. Consider preparing documents related to legal issues and what happens if you can’t take care of yourself or make decisions for your own care or well-being. You can consult an attorney for help preparing these documents, but many of them you can prepare on your own (you may need a notary or other official to endorse them, depending on the laws in your area).\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I care for a loved one with a neurodegenerative disease?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a loved one with a neurodegenerative disease, what you can do depends on the condition they have, how advanced it is, other health concerns and more. Your loved one and/or their healthcare provider are the best people to tell you what they might need.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be hard for many people with these conditions to talk about what they’re facing. Many people with these conditions fear what’s happening or what might happen in the future. That can make it difficult for them to ask for help. Many feel embarrassed about asking for help or the thought that they might need to rely on others.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a loved one with a neurodegenerative disease, here are some things you can do or keep in mind:\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t treat them like an invalid or burden. Degenerative brain conditions make it hard to do things you used to do easily. Eventually, these conditions can make it hard to do even simple things like bathe, get dressed or go to the bathroom. Treat them with as much dignity and respect as you would anyone. Remember that they’re a person you care about, not the condition they have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask what they need. Sometimes, people facing a difficult situation just want to vent. If a loved one opens up to you, it may be helpful to ask if they want a listening ear or if they want feedback, suggestions or assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Offer to help. Your loved one may have trouble asking for help. They might not want to ask for help, or might not feel like they need it. Sometimes, helping them with little things can make it easier for them to rely on you for bigger needs. Going with them to medical appointments, assisting with errands or helping with household chores are all ways you can pitch in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take care of yourself. Caregivers can experience burnout, too. It’s much harder to care for others when you aren’t taking care of yourself. It’s also important to acknowledge when your loved one needs a higher level of care than you can provide. Trying to care for them when you don’t have the training or resources can do more harm than good.\n",
      "\n",
      "When should I see my healthcare provider, or when should I seek care?\n",
      "\n",
      "You should see a healthcare provider anytime you have brain-related symptoms or issues that affect your routine and activities. Early detection of neurodegenerative diseases can make a big difference in delaying how fast the disease worsens.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you know you have a neurodegenerative disease, you should also seek care when:\n",
      "\n",
      "Your provider has you scheduled for an appointment. Making these appointments helps your provider monitor your condition and recommend adjustments to treatment or lifestyle that might help.\n",
      "\n",
      "You notice changes in your symptoms. These kinds of changes can be important information for your provider to consider as they work to monitor and care for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You notice side effects or changes in treatment effectiveness. Treatments like medication may become less effective with time. Tell your provider if you notice differences in treatment effectiveness. That can also help them adjust your treatment to be more effective and monitor your condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your healthcare provider can also tell you about other things to watch for that mean you need to see them soon or that you need medical care right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "A note from Cleveland Clinic\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding out you have a neurodegenerative disease can make you feel shocked, scared or angry. It can also be troubling to face the idea that you might not be able to take care of yourself and live independently because you have one of these conditions. You may also feel that way if you have a loved one with one of these conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "While neurodegenerative diseases are permanent and incurable, experts and researchers are continuing to uncover new ways to diagnose and treat these conditions. That means healthcare providers can do even more to treat these conditions, give you a chance to live longer and keep your quality of life as high as possible. That way, you can limit how much these conditions affect your life and focus on what matters most to you.\n",
